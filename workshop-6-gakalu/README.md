    * `GET /courses`
    * `GET /courses/:course_id`
    * `POST /courses`
    * `PUT /courses/:course_id`
    * `DELETE /courses/:course_id`
## Notes  
* Provid simple StyleSheet object.
* Do not upload any zip files into your repo.
* Do not push any deps (node_modules).
* Remember to honor the project integrityÂ and authenticity of your code.
* Submission deadline is 10 PM.
